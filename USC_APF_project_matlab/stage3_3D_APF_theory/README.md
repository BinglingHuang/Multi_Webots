Matlab_3D_APF_TEST_CODE
3D_APF folder is a matlab test project to test the 3D APF field.
Uncompleted version.
conv_3D_APF_Field.m code build the convolutional configuration space, 
construct the APF field using wave-front-algorithm.
RRT_path_planning.m code generates the 3D route using the C-space
(configuration space).
Use test.m to try some other path-planning algorithm such as
wave-front-algorithm and gradient-descent algorithm.
