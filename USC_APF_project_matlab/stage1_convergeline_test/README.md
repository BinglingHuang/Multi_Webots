Matlab_tool_box_converge_line_test_code

This folder is to test the different type of field (mathematical model)
taking effect on the converge line.

Field_code folder: draw different quiver plots 
(point-potential-field\curve-potential-field\Gassian-field)
(GMM-Gaussian MIXED MODEL is the Alternate model)
run three ***_quiver.m separately to see the quiver plot

mathwork-robotics-mobile-robotics-simulation folder:
robotic simulator proveided by the matlab to simulate the robotic algorithm
Before runnning the animation code in the swarm_behavior_test_code folder
Run '.\mathworks-robotics-mobile-robotics-simulation-toolbox\tool-box\startMobileRoboticsSimulationToolbox.m'

swarm_behavior_test_code folder:
Use the robotic simulator to see the animation of the three type of
field model. Run matlab_test_code.m and follow the instruction.
